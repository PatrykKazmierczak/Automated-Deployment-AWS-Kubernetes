# üöÄ Project: Automated Deployment of a Microservices Application on AWS with Kubernetes

## Overview:
In this project, we will build a **microservices application**, containerize it with **Docker**, deploy it to **AWS** using **Kubernetes**, and automate the infrastructure provisioning using **Terraform**. The **CI/CD pipeline** will be managed by **CircleCI**, and all code will be version-controlled using **Git**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Involved:
- **Linux**: Development and local testing.
- **Docker**: Containerization of microservices.
- **AWS**: EKS for Kubernetes cluster, ECR for Docker image storage, and other resources like VPC, subnets, IAM roles, etc.
- **Kubernetes**: To orchestrate the deployment of Docker containers on AWS.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to provision and manage AWS resources.
- **CircleCI**: CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment process.
- **Git**: Version control for all code and infrastructure definitions.

## üìù Project Steps:

### 1. Application Development:
- **Microservices**: 
  - Build a simple microservices-based web application with at least two services (e.g., frontend and backend).
  - **Language**: Choose a language you're comfortable with (e.g., Node.js, Python, etc.).
  - **Linux**: Develop and test your microservices locally in a Linux environment.

### 2. Containerization (Docker):
- **Dockerize each microservice**:
  - Write individual `Dockerfiles` for each service.
  - Use `docker-compose` locally to run and test the services together.
  - Push Docker images to **AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry)** or **Docker Hub**.

### 3. Infrastructure as Code (Terraform):
- **Provision AWS resources using Terraform**:
  - **VPC, Subnets, Security Groups**: Create the necessary networking layers.
  - **EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**: Use Terraform to create and configure an EKS cluster to manage your microservices.
  - **IAM Roles**: Set up IAM roles and policies to allow the EKS cluster to communicate with AWS services.
  - **RDS (Optional)**: If needed, provision an RDS instance for your application‚Äôs database.

### 4. Kubernetes Deployment:
- **Kubernetes manifests**:
  - Write Kubernetes manifests (e.g., `deployment.yaml`, `service.yaml`, etc.) to define how your microservices should be deployed.
  - Set up **ConfigMaps** and **Secrets** to manage configuration and sensitive data.
  - Deploy the application to the EKS cluster using `kubectl`.

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline (CircleCI):
- **Git repository**:
  - Host your source code and Terraform scripts in a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).
- **CircleCI Pipeline**:
  - Set up a CircleCI pipeline that performs the following steps:
    1. **Lint & Test**: Run unit tests on your microservices.
    2. **Docker Build & Push**: Build and push Docker images to your registry.
    3. **Terraform Apply**: Use Terraform to provision or update infrastructure on AWS.
    4. **Kubernetes Deployment**: Deploy the latest Docker images to the Kubernetes cluster on EKS.

### 6. Monitoring & Logging (Optional):
- Integrate **AWS CloudWatch** for monitoring and logging of your Kubernetes cluster and application.

### 7. Version Control (Git):
- All your source code, Terraform configuration, and Kubernetes manifests should be version-controlled in **Git**.
  - Create separate branches for development, testing, and production environments.
  - Use **Git workflows** to manage code reviews and merging.
